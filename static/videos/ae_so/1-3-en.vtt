00:06.800 --> 00:09.800
How things used to be

00:10.850 --> 00:12.850
Laundry Day

00:13.400 --> 00:15.650
The girls also had to work,

00:16.100 --> 00:21.500
either with mother in the kitchen or they had to help with the laundry.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.700
Doing the laundry was a long procedure.

00:27.350 --> 00:34.800
The really dirty outer clothes or the trousers worn in the forest were put to soak the night before.

00:35.050 --> 00:40.200
To do that soap suds and soapy water were kept from the week before.

00:40.600 --> 00:46.450
You had to remember to fill the wooden washtubs (which had small cracks) with water.

00:47.850 --> 00:51.400
They were kept in a damp place

00:51.939 --> 00:55.850
under the cellar steps so that they never did fully dry out,

00:57.750 --> 01:03.000
but all the same it could happen that it would take far too long before they stopped leaking.

01:03.850 --> 01:06.850
That was why they were filled with water the night before

01:07.050 --> 01:11.950
and then they were put in a place where it did not matter if they leaked.

01:12.450 --> 01:16.300
When it rained they were put under the gutter

01:16.900 --> 01:19.750
and in the morning they were watertight.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.050
When a woman wanted to do the laundry, then she got up early to light the fire in the wood burner.

01:28.300 --> 01:33.850
A lot of warm water was required and the laundry was done anyway in the kitchen.

01:34.650 --> 01:37.650
Very few had a laundry room.

01:38.500 --> 01:43.000
The fire was kept alight until the washing was finished.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.550
In summer it was like being in an oven in the kitchen.

01:50.350 --> 01:55.900
The dirtiest pieces of clothing were laid on a washboard or were brushed,

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
or they were put in a narrow high drum and were pumped up and down with a plunger.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.050
The other pieces of clothing were washed by hand,

02:07.250 --> 02:13.600
They were prewashed, rinsed and then washed again and rinsed again.

02:14.950 --> 02:19.450
The large washtub was filled with cold water

02:19.919 --> 02:22.919
and the washing powder was stirred in.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.450
First the white clothing was thrown in and boiled.

02:26.800 --> 02:32.000
Then after the white came the coloured wash and after that the dirtiest wash.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.900
Every wash was left for 10 minutes to boil.

02:36.850 --> 02:42.050
The hot clothing was fished from the washtub with wooden tongs.

02:42.500 --> 02:46.400
Then it was rinsed and washed again

02:47.100 --> 02:52.200
and then rinsed in warm water once or twice and after that rinsed twice in cold water.

02:52.750 --> 02:56.227
The cold rinse was done outside in the water trough.

02:56.650 --> 03:02.300
In winter it was often so cold you lost any feeling in your hands.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.950
For Godmother and Grandmother from the Chrauch in Matt it was even harder,

03:09.300 --> 03:12.300
because they still had no water in the kitchen.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.850
The water she wanted to boil had to be carried inside

03:16.900 --> 03:21.350
and they went outside to the water trough even in winter to rinse the laundry.

03:22.150 --> 03:24.600
Their hands nearly froze.

03:25.550 --> 03:32.600
A small lead ball wrapped in a small piece of cloth was swung around in the last rinse.

03:33.700 --> 03:39.500
The water turned slightly blue and the white wash looked cleaner.

03:41.550 --> 03:46.650
The hot water which was left in the washtub was put to use,

03:47.000 --> 03:51.850
such as for scrubbing the cellar steps or for washing the kitchen floor.

03:54.750 --> 04:01.100
Doing the laundry in winter was more tedious because the clothes which were hung up would freeze.

04:02.300 --> 04:07.550
That was why there was less laundry done in winter and the sheets were left on the beds longer.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.700
The Beglingers in Matt they didn't wash until the spring

04:13.700 --> 04:16.700
and then sheets were hung across a whole field.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.850
You could see that they were well situated.

04:22.300 --> 04:26.150
On a laundry day there was always polenta to eat.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.900
The wood burner was hot

04:29.350 --> 04:35.850
and in the late morning a pan was filled with water, milk, cornmeal and salt

04:36.250 --> 04:41.756
and then it cooked slowly and was ready for lunch.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.400
