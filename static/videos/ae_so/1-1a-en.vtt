Historical Society of Engi
presents

00:06.800 --> 00:09.800
How things used to be

00:10.850 --> 00:13.550
Outwork and work in the weaving mill

00:15.350 --> 00:22.150
The weaving mill or the machine as it was called was an important institution in the Glarnerland.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.502
In nearly every village there was a machine or a printing mill

00:26.900 --> 00:30.502
and in many homes there was someone who worked there.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.954
That is why the machine dictated the daily routine.

00:36.050 --> 00:39.900
In the morning at 6.40 and after midday at 12.40

00:40.558 --> 00:45.350
there came a loud whistle from the factory chimney in Engi.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.600
Then those who worked in the factory knew

00:50.850 --> 00:53.850
that they had to be on their way.

00:54.550 --> 01:00.750
You saw people coming from all directions. A large group came from the girls' home.

01:02.600 --> 01:08.400
Our mothers and other women, as long as their children were small, worked from home.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.490
They sewed the seams on the washcloths.

01:11.850 --> 01:15.850
Two sides were already seamed on the roll.

01:16.450 --> 01:19.808
On the other two they made a seam

01:20.037 --> 01:22.376
and then they had to sew on a hook.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.967
One washcloth had to be attached to the other.

01:27.967 --> 01:30.410
When finished there was a long snake.

01:31.350 --> 01:34.771
The women had no electric sewing machines.

01:35.381 --> 01:38.447
They had to pedal all day

01:38.650 --> 01:41.677
to run the sewing machines.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.886
From about the 4th class we had to help.

01:47.550 --> 01:50.930
We had to cut one washcloth from the other

01:50.950 --> 01:54.362
and then cut off the loose threads very neatly.

01:55.650 --> 01:59.553
At home we had to stack 100 washcloths

02:00.850 --> 02:03.487
and Mother tied up the pile.

02:04.750 --> 02:08.357
In a basket we carried the bundles up to the factory.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.675
On the one side mother carried and on the other myself.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.880
When the basket was heavy every now and then we put it down

02:19.150 --> 02:20.960
and changed sides.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.497
The sewing department was at that time at the top of the weaving mill.

02:27.150 --> 02:31.356
There were a lot of women who sewed

02:31.750 --> 02:34.277
and the boss was a woman.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.600
Otherwise the work was distributed so

02:38.600 --> 02:43.376
that the women worked on the weaving looms and the men were the foremen.

02:44.200 --> 02:49.833
They did the work that required supervision or strength.

02:51.050 --> 02:55.950
The head of the sewing department Regi controlled the piles,

02:56.800 --> 03:02.700
counted one or two and then looked to check if the threads were tidily cut off.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.100
I was always anxious because it would have been my fault

03:08.650 --> 03:13.674
if there were not 100 in the pile or the threads were still hanging on.

03:15.450 --> 03:19.003
Later when the oldest sister went to secondary school,

03:19.400 --> 03:21.118
mother went to work in the factory,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.558
starting in the sewing department.

03:25.250 --> 03:29.436
In the factory the women did piecework,

03:30.436 --> 03:33.506
who worked harder, earned more.

03:34.350 --> 03:37.389
The foreman and forewoman checked in the sewing department

03:37.444 --> 03:41.838
that the pay differences did not become too great.

03:43.250 --> 03:46.591
Because mother had worked at home alone for a long time

03:46.800 --> 03:49.187
she had made a clever discovery,

03:49.590 --> 03:54.623
she found out how to sew on a hook faster and neater.

03:55.400 --> 04:00.505
She could sew faster in a short time and could earn more.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.347
Then Regi said to her one day:

04:05.750 --> 04:11.840
<i>Look you earn too much would you not prefer to work in the weaving mill?</i>

04:13.100 --> 04:17.670
What could mother do? She went to the weaving mill.

04:18.650 --> 04:23.671
She had worked before she got married in the weaving mill at the Hinterdorf

04:23.800 --> 04:25.952
and knew the work.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.500
But in the weaving mill the foreman wanted to keep the balance

04:31.600 --> 04:34.914
and did not want any trouble between the looms.

04:36.050 --> 04:41.679
When there were too many weaving faults the foreman took a few woven pieces

04:42.100 --> 04:44.874
and showed them to all the weavers.

04:46.200 --> 04:53.948
He said to those with a lot of faults, that this was not acceptable.

04:54.450 --> 04:59.745
This was done to improve the quality and to keep the balance.

05:01.100 --> 05:07.989
That was so you could see that some were better and perhaps earned more than the others.

05:08.850 --> 05:12.926
At that time when there was a factory newspaper in Engi

05:13.150 --> 05:16.483
the best weavers were portrayed.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.967
The foremen were usually able to influence the situation.

05:22.350 --> 05:24.900
They were responsible for the maintenance of the looms

05:25.100 --> 05:28.543
and when a loom did not run properly during the day

05:28.700 --> 05:32.450
then they could make a weaver wait for a long time or perhaps for not so long

05:32.700 --> 05:34.786
until the loom was running.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.789
Frau Kläsi from Luchsingen told me

05:40.000 --> 05:42.963
that her mother was a very diligent weaver.

05:43.850 --> 05:46.915
The foreman said to her one day:

05:48.274 --> 05:51.197
<i>Listen you earn too much,</i>

05:52.274 --> 05:54.964
<i>go down to the cellar for a while everyday</i>

05:55.900 --> 05:59.148
<i>and you can dance for a short time.</i>

05:59.900 --> 06:02.447
It was dreadfully loud in the weaving hall.

06:03.100 --> 06:06.447
As a child I sometimes picked mother up

06:06.950 --> 06:10.074
and a couple of times was allowed to go into the weaving hall.

06:10.950 --> 06:16.794
There the air was full of noise and full of dust from the cotton threads.

06:18.150 --> 06:21.115
Mother explained everything to me and how the loom functioned

06:21.550 --> 06:26.555
and what happened with the pattern card which hung down

06:27.000 --> 06:28.798
and all what she had to do.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.592
Cousin Zinki my Grandmother's sister

06:34.850 --> 06:37.908
worked for 53 years in the machine.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.100
During this whole time she came down from the plateau

06:41.400 --> 06:45.850
above Obbort summer and winter and walked to Linthal.

06:46.550 --> 06:50.869
First to Bebié and then in the later years to Sigrist.

06:51.950 --> 06:56.300
When snow fell in the night she had to get up at 4 a.m.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.230
to get to the factory for 6 a.m.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.956
She had to wade through the snow and could not walk fast.

07:06.950 --> 07:14.150
When there was a heavy snow fall one of her brothers would go ahead and make a path through the snow.

07:15.400 --> 07:19.900
In the evening after 6 p.m. she had to tramp up to the plateau.

07:20.450 --> 07:22.386
She took a midday meal with her,

07:22.600 --> 07:25.995
bread and something with it, cheese or bacon

07:27.100 --> 07:30.360
and a little coffee in a pot,

07:30.650 --> 07:33.838
which she could warm up at the home of acquaintances.

07:36.150 --> 07:41.274
At home she had to do the housework for her two single brothers.

07:41.900 --> 07:46.100
The two were farmers and Zinki was their bread winner

07:46.550 --> 07:50.168
as their mother said to her as long as she lived.

07:51.050 --> 07:54.592
Zinki cooked and washed and cleaned for the two.

07:55.050 --> 07:57.228
The food was simple.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.322
On Sunday Zinki made a pan full of soup,

08:02.600 --> 08:05.430
which was warmed up every day

08:05.550 --> 08:08.800
and at the end of the week it was sour.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.756
Cousin Zinki was sometimes cross with her brothers

08:15.000 --> 08:18.486
when they made her unnecessary work.

08:19.850 --> 08:24.977
In the house below Basi Zinki lived the Soldenhoff family.

08:26.200 --> 08:30.431
The boys were always with Niklaus, one of the brothers.

08:31.750 --> 08:36.429
One evening  the youngest Soldenhoff did not come home.

08:37.300 --> 08:42.612
When at last he walked in the door his mother was cross with him:

08:43.250 --> 08:46.320
<i>Why did you stay up there so long?</i>

08:46.600 --> 08:51.005
<i>I told you, you had to come down before it got dark.</i>

08:51.800 --> 08:53.035
Then the boy said:

08:54.100 --> 08:58.993
<i>You see Niklaus had put on a clean shirt today</i>

08:59.500 --> 09:03.242
and whilst lighting the fire he burnt the sleeve again.

09:04.600 --> 09:10.351
<i>then I had to wait until Zinki came home to hear what she said to him.</i>

09:13.000 --> 09:17.148
Zinki apart from all the other things did handicraft when she had time

09:17.700 --> 09:20.837
and that was usually on a Sunday.

09:21.600 --> 09:27.025
She often brought home balls of yarn from the weaving mill to crotchet and knit.

09:27.950 --> 09:33.121
From warping there was always spare yarn which could be wound up

09:33.750 --> 09:36.308
when you did not need it on the loom.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.588
Next to every weaving loom there was always one of these balls hanging down.

09:41.700 --> 09:47.430
Now and then she took one of them home to use.

09:49.150 --> 09:52.074
Zinki started to crochet and knit when she was young.

09:52.950 --> 09:57.230
They stopped her going walking out early enough.

09:58.500 --> 10:05.633
As a young girl she would have liked to have strolled with her friends to the Tierfehd [a place south of Linthal].

10:07.000 --> 10:09.922
Then her father said to her mother:

10:10.300 --> 10:15.426
<i>No, do you want to spoil her like the older one?</i>

10:16.450 --> 10:20.226
<i>Then she will probably marry a Kleintaler.</i> [someone from the valley between Schwanden and Elm]

10:21.600 --> 10:23.665
She did not like it

10:23.900 --> 10:28.877
that Adelheid my Grandmother was married far back in the Kleintal.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.757
That was probably as far away as America for her.

10:34.350 --> 10:39.514
And anyway Kleintaler were considered to be worth less than Grosstaler [the people in the valley between Schwanden and Linthal].

10:41.050 --> 10:45.670
With this it was the end of the chapter, walking out was finished for ever

10:46.500 --> 10:51.230
and Zinki stayed at home to knit and crochet.

10:53.075 --> 10:58.079
They sometimes took on a girl in the weaving mill who was too young.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.106
I met someone in Zürich,

11:02.650 --> 11:07.550
at that time she was called Frau Schmid and she had worked in the machine in Rüti.

11:08.300 --> 11:13.872
They were a big family with a lot of children at home and the father drank his wage

11:14.900 --> 11:17.792
and because of this they took the girl on ahead of time.

11:18.950 --> 11:25.781
When the factory inspector came they had to put her in a big wooden box,

11:26.150 --> 11:28.043
she was really small.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.094
They told her:

11:30.450 --> 11:34.317
<i>Make sure you don’t sneeze or make any sort of noise</i>

11:35.400 --> 11:37.476
otherwise we will have problems.

11:38.400 --> 11:45.067
And Frau Schmid sat in the wooden box terribly frightened and kept thinking

11:45.600 --> 11:48.476
<i>oh if only I don’t have to sneeze.</i>

11:50.750 --> 11:54.869
Grutsch Marie went to the spinning mill to work at a young age.

11:55.100 --> 11:59.515
They were 9 children at home and Marie was the eldest

12:00.300 --> 12:04.215
and she had to earn money as soon as she was able to.

12:05.500 --> 12:11.996
When she started, she worked in the spinning mill from 6 a.m. until 6.30 in the evening.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.397
Later the working hours were shorter

12:15.750 --> 12:19.986
and even later the Saturday afternoon was free.

12:21.250 --> 12:27.033
In the morning when Marie went to work her mother called after her

12:27.650 --> 12:32.549
and told her what she had to do when she came home because she would be in the barn.

12:33.050 --> 12:36.470
On a Saturday she always had to sweep the living room.

12:38.750 --> 12:43.752
Now and again the Master Mr. Spälti came to the spinning mill.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.629
Then one hardly dared to breathe.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.787
But he just walked up and down the aisle

12:52.500 --> 12:55.588
and never went close to the looms.

12:57.950 --> 13:02.953
We cannot imagine how hard life was for many people.

13:03.703 --> 13:13.264
I was told by a man about his great grandmother who in 1880 lost her husband.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.028
She had a large brood of children.

13:17.600 --> 13:23.111
The oldest ones had already left school. They had to go to the factory

13:23.819 --> 13:25.846
but they had no shoes.

13:26.782 --> 13:31.839
They had to walk barefoot in winter from Schwanden to Haslen.

13:33.298 --> 13:36.476
Frau Kläsi from Luchsingen told me,

13:37.097 --> 13:40.709
her grandmother had once again given birth to a child

13:41.387 --> 13:43.926
but she could not stay at home for long.

13:44.781 --> 13:48.509
Already after a few days she had to go back to work.

13:49.224 --> 13:53.387
The older girls had to bring the baby to her in the machine,

13:53.749 --> 13:58.667
which she fed quickly and then the girls went home with the little one.

14:00.869 --> 14:04.748
People with ailments were not wanted as workers.

14:06.225 --> 14:12.232
Grandfather in Matt and his brother with rickets both worked in the spinning mill.

14:13.185 --> 14:18.031
The brother with rickets had to crawl to the spinning mill on a stool.

14:19.100 --> 14:25.465
They said in the spinning mill, we will only take on the ailing person if the healthy one comes too.

14:26.750 --> 14:30.479
Grandfather had to simply work for one and half people,

14:31.104 --> 14:34.352
but this way there were still two wages.

14:36.101 --> 14:41.990
When grandfather noticed that his ailing brother no longer had the strength to work,

14:42.266 --> 14:44.228
he told them at home.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.956
But mother and father said,

14:48.266 --> 14:50.996
they should simply carry on going to work,

14:51.141 --> 14:53.288
work had never harmed anyone.

14:54.788 --> 15:01.350
Then grandfather gave in his notice so that his brother was able to stay at home.

15:04.416 --> 15:08.628
In the family Wartenweiler in Rüti, the father had a heart problem.

15:09.541 --> 15:13.599
He could hardly take a few steps without having to rest.

15:14.668 --> 15:18.237
But they really needed his wage.

15:20.217 --> 15:22.949
Then his work colleagues

15:23.275 --> 15:27.805
came to collect him and they carried him to the machine and back four times a day.

15:28.779 --> 15:33.079
In the machine they sat him on a stool next to the loom.

15:34.190 --> 15:39.162
This way it was possible for him to be the family bread winner.

15:41.462 --> 15:46.323
In the Legler factory in Diesbach a woman worked who had deformed feet.

15:46.904 --> 15:51.716
She wore high men's big boots summer and winter.

15:52.355 --> 15:55.121
When it was icy and slippery in winter,

15:55.510 --> 15:59.639
she slept the night in the factory on a wooden box.

16:01.750 --> 16:04.550
The winter was altogether a lot more difficult

16:04.704 --> 16:09.302
because one didn't have good shoes or enough warm clothing.

16:10.417 --> 16:15.791
At the beginning of the 20th century most women wore no underpants.

16:16.782 --> 16:21.945
Even I knew an old woman in Engi who didn't have any on.

16:22.737 --> 16:28.551
She had her allotment next to our home and when she had to make a wee, she just let it go.

16:30.185 --> 16:33.238
In the winter it was really draughty from down below.

16:34.594 --> 16:38.700
That was why a woman from Schwändi who worked in the Steg in Mitlödi

16:38.978 --> 16:42.187
put on all the 3 skirts that she possessed in winter.

16:43.350 --> 16:49.075
When it snowed or when there was a really blustery snow storm, she put the top skirt over her head

16:49.576 --> 16:53.316
and held all three skirts together in front with one hand.

16:54.182 --> 16:59.195
This way she kept dry and stayed slightly warmer down below.

17:01.073 --> 17:06.714
When there was a lot of snow and it was cold, the men as well as my Father

17:06.859 --> 17:11.109
would wind calf bandages around their trousers or wore half stockings.

17:12.829 --> 17:15.076
In time things got better.

17:15.745 --> 17:20.388
The machines became more efficient, the wages better and there were more clothes.

17:21.788 --> 17:27.824
In time due to the higher wages the textile industry declined.

17:29.238 --> 17:31.473
The machines had to close.
Die Maschinen mussten schliessen.

17:32.710 --> 17:35.586
A woman from Ennenda said laughingly,

17:35.946 --> 17:40.472
when the Holenstein factory was closed, they sold printing blocks in mass,

17:40.574 --> 17:44.572
ones which can nowadays cost a few hundred francs each to buy.

17:46.156 --> 17:49.804
They used them to heat her home all winter

17:50.544 --> 17:53.726
and thus a fortune went up the chimney.

17:56.465 --> 18:03.126
Many of the factory workers looked for further earnings alongside their day jobs.

18:03.582 --> 18:07.549
These kind of opportunities arose occasionally in every village.

18:08.478 --> 18:12.076
In Engi up on the Gufel there was a holiday home that belonged to the citizens of Zürich.

18:12.817 --> 18:16.509
In the summer children from Zürich came up to the holiday home.

18:17.057 --> 18:21.630
On the first day the men carried the suitcases up in a wooden frame on their backs

18:22.434 --> 18:25.789
and then every evening food and the post.

18:26.301 --> 18:29.029
They packed the wooden frames full at the bakery Kislig

18:29.302 --> 18:34.681
and walked up the winding road for more than an hour and down again.

18:34.900 --> 18:38.445
Sometimes they even went up twice on one evening.

18:39.544 --> 18:43.271
In Sool, at the time the alp buildings in Fessis were being built,

18:43.800 --> 18:45.787
men carried up sacks of cement in the evening.

18:46.269 --> 18:50.356
Each sack weighed half a hundredweight, 25 kilos.

18:51.017 --> 18:54.868
That was well paid work, 5 francs for a sack,

18:55.314 --> 18:56.908
and that was a lot of money.

18:58.136 --> 19:02.611
That was why men from the Therma factory and the flour mill queued in the evening.

19:03.617 --> 19:09.508
The really strong ones took on two sacks and carried both for as long as they could manage.

19:10.257 --> 19:13.957
Then they left one and carried just one up

19:14.698 --> 19:18.680
and went back for the second one and carried that up.

19:19.940 --> 19:23.203
They earned 10 francs in one evening.

19:24.696 --> 19:29.948
That was how one worked from getting up until going to bed.

19:30.350 --> 19:34.702
The children also had to work as soon as they were able to.

19:35.626 --> 19:38.679
Sami Zopfi from Schwanden told me,

19:39.516 --> 19:41.364
that from the 6th class onwards

19:41.498 --> 19:45.283
he had to go every Saturday with a cart pulled by three horses to the Kleintal

19:45.450 --> 19:46.999
to deliver flour.

19:47.818 --> 19:49.633
He had to go to all the bakeries,

19:49.737 --> 19:55.357
baker This, baker Heiri, the grocers, Christens and to the baker in Matt.

19:56.497 --> 19:58.745
He had to unload the sacks himself

19:59.858 --> 20:04.230
and before he went home he often had to load wood.

20:05.500 --> 20:09.598
People wanted to give him things to take to the Kleintal

20:10.338 --> 20:13.949
or he had to go here and there to pass on a message.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.870
This led to him having a good memory.

20:18.772 --> 20:22.669
He was able to retain up to 27 things in his head.

20:24.183 --> 20:29.354
But anyway he sometimes did not get home until nearly midnight.

20:29.934 --> 20:32.145
Then he had to unload the wood

20:32.255 --> 20:36.509
and feed and water the horses, not even to mention himself.

20:37.971 --> 20:41.879
Once a strong five year old horse broke away

20:42.655 --> 20:45.197
and tore a leather strap.

20:46.300 --> 20:49.708
Then the coachman Jacques in Engi told him

20:50.587 --> 20:52.461
to go to the saddler.

20:53.935 --> 20:57.785
The saddler asked, <i>have you got any money?</i>

20:58.900 --> 21:02.268
He answered, <i>yes 5 francs.</i>

21:04.150 --> 21:09.600
And the saddler said, <i>because you are just a boy, I will repair it for nothing.</i>

21:09.550 --> 21:12.309
The saddler could have well used the money,

21:12.777 --> 21:17.346
he was poor and saddlers did not have much to live off.
